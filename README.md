This repo contains code assignments for the
University of Minnesota Computer Science class 4131 -
[Internet Programming](http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2012/csci4131/),
which I took Spring 2012 semester.

Not really good work, just trying to hit due
dates and make it readable enough to get the grade.
